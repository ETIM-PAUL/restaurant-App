This project is built with nest js for backend, next js for frontend. 
It allows restaurant owners register their restaurants, allowing users
that registerd as customers to search for their favourite restaurants, 
place orders, make reservations, leave a review. The restaurant owners 
can then carry out orders, read reviews, manage their restaurant. etc.

This Work is hosted on vercel (client-side) and heroku (server-side)
